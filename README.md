# first-website
I have just commenced on my journey towards website development. 
I learnt html in 3 days. I got the idea how to design the structure for the web.
Now that I know how to give structure to my web, I am learning to beautify my webpage.
For the reason, I am learning css. 
Let's see how much will I enjoy this.
